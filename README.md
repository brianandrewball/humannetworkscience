# Human Network Science Project
![...](HMN_logo.jpg)

This project brings humanities and social science researchers together with network scientists to build bridges between qualitative and quantitative research methods across disciplinary divides. 

Through the development of a novel case study, a Python coding bootcamp, and the hosting of a showcase research event, the proposed programme of investigation will produce training materials enabling humanists and social scientists to use graph computing in their work - all while beginning to articulate a philosophy of network science. 

This repository will collect all the materials relative to the project.
